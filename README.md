WiFi Temperature Sensor
-----------------------

The aim is to make a cheap and simple Open Source WiFi temperature sensor.

# Objectives

* ~10 GBP BOM cost
* USB Powered
* Primarily hand solderable
* Plug-and-play components (ESP8266 / AHT breakout board / OLED screen)

# Notes

The genesis of this was a colleague asked if I could build something for his house that could monitor each room in a large house with many rooms. I wanted an excuse to try making a PCB and electronics design so I did this.

It then came to mind that this is a good "intro to soldering" exercise as it enables people to solder both through-hole and surface mount components and the USB header can be soldered using either a hot air pencil or a hot plate.
